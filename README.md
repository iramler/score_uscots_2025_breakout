## What is SCORE?

[![The SCORE
Network](https://img.youtube.com/vi/eBasNuOMTUs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBasNuOMTUs&t=1s)

- SCORE Network website:
  <a href="https://scorenetwork.org" target="_blank">scorenetwork.org</a>
  - For general information about the project (and links to all
    materials).

## Level 1 - Instructor Choice (Modules)

A SCORE module is a collection of teaching materials built around one or
more sport-related dataset(s).

- Module Repository: <a href="https://modules.scorenetwork.org"
  target="_blank">modules.scorenetwork.org</a>
  - Links to existing modules, searchable by sport and statistical
    topic.
  - The <a href="https://modules.scorenetwork.org/preprints.html"
    target="_blank">preprint servers</a> also have a lot of additional
    modules to peruse.

### Three Examples

- <a
  href="https://modules.scorenetwork.org/esports/league-of-legends-buffing-nerfing/"
  target="_blank">League of Legends - Buffing and Nerfing</a>
  - Investigating game play statistics for League of Legends champions
    in two different patches.
  - Uses histograms and outlier detection (1.5 IQR Rule)
- <a
  href="https://iramler.github.io/slu_score_preprints/basketball/nba_wingspans_and_performance/"
  target="_blank">NBA Wingspan &amp; Performance (Preprint Server)</a>
  - Exploring wingspan and performance in the NBA by cleaning, merging
    and analyzing datasets.
  - Webscraping, Data Visualization, Data Wrangling, Joining / Merging
- <a href="https://isle.stat.cmu.edu/SCORE/Marathons_SCORE_Template/"
  target="_blank">Marathon Record-Setting Over Time</a>
  - Determining whether the setting of world records in the marathon is
    historically a Poisson process.
  - Includes extra topics such as the memoryless property

## Level 2 - Student Choice (Data Repository)

- Data Repository: <a href="https://data.scorenetwork.org"
  target="_blank">data.scorenetwork.org</a>
  - Lots of example datasets that can be used to start the process of
    building a module.

### BREAKOUT ACTIVITY - Find some data!

Take the role of a student and use the SCORE Data Repository to datasets
for each of the projects outlined below:

### Project \#1: Data Description

Find a dataset with at least 30 cases and information for at least one
categorical and three quantitative variables. Use summary statistics and
graphs to describe individual variables and any interesting
relationships between them.

### Project \#3: Regression

Find a dataset with a quantitative variable that you would like to
predict and 3-5 potential predictors. Look at scatterplots,
correlations, and simple linear models to see which are effective
predictors (possibly also include multiple regression models).

## Level 3 - Student Contributions (Review and/or Submit Materials)

A good activity for a Sports Analytics Club or individual students
interested in sports-based statistics applications is to work through a
SCORE module (especially those in the preprint repositories) and provide
a student review of the materials.

- Link for student reviews <a

  target="_blank">Google form for Student Reviews</a>
  - Form will include a dropdown list of modules to review.

Many of the submissions to the SCORE Data and Module Repositories have
originated from undergraduate students. Submitting a dataset is
generally a good first step, before expanding to do a full module.
