> This page provides information and resources for the [USCOTS 2025 Breakout Session](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots25/program/breakouts/4C){target="_blank"} on different strategies for using resources from NSF-funded Sports Content for Outreach, Research, and Education, [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org){target="_blank"}, to engage students with sports-motivated statistics activities and data.

## About this Breakout Session

This 3-hour workshop introduces participants to the SCORE Networkâ€”an NSF-funded initiative that supports sports-based statistics education. Participants will explore examples, brainstorm their own module ideas, and begin outlining a new module for submission. Modules submitted within four weeks of USCOTS will receive an **expedited peer review**.

No strong sports knowledge required...but an interest in using real data in the classroom is mandatory!
